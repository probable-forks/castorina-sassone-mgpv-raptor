This is a fork of the code repository for [Mastering Graphics Programming with Vulkan](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-graphics-programming-with-vulkan/9781803244792?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803244792), published by Packt.

This fork is intended solely as a sandbox, for experimental purposes, only. As a bemused and somewhat skeptical reader of the book who respects its authors none the less, I guarantee not one modicum of sanity behind the experimentation or hacks committed to this fork – peruse them at your peril!
